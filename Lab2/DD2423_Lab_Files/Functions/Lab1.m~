% we use fftwave function to generate all the images
% we need: Real, imaginarty, abs, and angle
%All the images will be 128x128 pixel big

%%Question  1 
Size = 128; 
%The first Point != 0 is in the coordinates
p = 5;
q = 9;

 

%Assigned 1 to that coordinate
figure;
fftwave(p , q, Size );
%The next step is to try different points (p,q)
Values =[9,5;17,9;17,121;5,1;125,1];

for i=1:size(Values,1)
    figure;
    fftwave(Values(i,1),Values(i,2),Size);
end

%%Question 2

close all;
clear all; 
% we choose a point in the left upper side of the image so we dont need to
% transform the coordinates
u = 5;
v = 9;
Size = 128;
img = zeros(Size,Size);
re = zeros(Size,Size);
sol = zeros(Size,Size);
%Now we need to get the value in the spatial domain of every pixel
%(128*128) then we need a loop like the following
for m = 1:Size
    for n = 1:Size
            f = 2 * pi * ((m*u + n*v)/Size);
            sol(m,n) = 1/Size^2 *( cos(f) + i*sin(f));
            re(m,n) = 1/Size^2 * cos(f) ;
            img(m,n) = 1/Size^2 * i*sin(f) ;
    end
end


%We show first the propagation on the x axis
figure(1)
for i=1:Size
    plot(real(sol(:,i)))
    pause(0.1)
end

%We show first then the propagation on the y axis
figure(2)
for i=1:Size
    plot(real(sol(i,:)))
    pause(0.1)
end
